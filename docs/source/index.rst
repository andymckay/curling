Curling
===================================

A REST client that wraps `slumber <https://github.com/dstufft/slumber>`_ to
provide a nice interface to `tastypie <https://github.com/toastdriven/django-tastypie>`_
sites for Django.

Curling is under construction right now. It's named curling because of curl and
curlish. And I enjoy curling.
